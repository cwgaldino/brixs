"""The brixs.multiplet module provides tools for multiplet calculations of XPS,
XES XAS, and RIXS spectra

This module is based on Crispy 0.7.3 written by Marius Retegan. Therefore, it 
is instructive to have some familiarity Crispy. The latest version can be 
downloaded at,

https://www.esrf.fr/computing/scientific/crispy/

This implementation, as well as Crispy, requires a Quanty executable 
from Maurits W. Haverkort. It that can be downloaded at,

https://www.quanty.org/index.html

Therefore, if you use this module on publications (brixs.multiplet). Please, 
cite Crispy 0.7.3 and Quanty. You can refer to their respective webpages to 
learn how to do so.

Note that this module was only tested on windows and for a limited number of 
calculation parameters. Please, report bugs!
